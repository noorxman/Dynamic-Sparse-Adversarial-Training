# Dynamic Sparse Adversarial Training for Robust Image Classification

Adversarial training has proven effective against white-box attacks. However, adversarial training is prone to overfitting on the adversarial samples during training. Dynamic sparsity in neural networks has shown to effectively reduce parameter count and regularize networks while maintaining high accuracy. To mitigate the issue of overfitting in adversarial training, this empirical research explores the interplay between adversarial robustness and dynamic sparsity in image classification.

For more information refer to the [paper](ACV_DSEAT.pdf) describing the methodology, results and discussions as part of an Advanced Computer Vision Class.

The Foundation of the code consists of the merger from several repositories: [Dynamic Sparse Training Procedure](https://github.com/Shiweiliuiiiiiii/In-Time-Over-Parameterization), [Adversarial Attack and Defense Methods](https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust), and [CNN Visualizations](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations).
